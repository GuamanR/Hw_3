1. Build out the file paths in the image. Your root directory (folder) will be the highlighted word **directories. Every highlighted word is a new directory(folder) and the non-highlighted words are plain old files.** 

	Directory was created 

2. If I start in my root directory (in this case it is called directories). How would I navigate to the directory called food?

	cd images
	cd clipart
	cd food

3. From food, how would I navigate to Poe, EdgarAllen?

	cd ..
	cd ..
	cd ..
	cd e-texts
	cd Poe,EdgarAllan

4. How would I be able to tell the contents of Poe, EdgarAllen?

	Once in the Poe,EdgarAllan folder, use ls to list the contents

5. Navigate to images, and use the command that will tell you the exact path of where you are. 

	The command for this is pwd 
/Users/Richie/desktop/directories/images

6. While in images, create a folder called photographs.

	mkdir photographs 
	
7. Navigate to your new directory, and create a new file called sunrise. Oh, and make it a .jpg file. (Windows get a freebie here).

	cd photographs
	touch sunrise.jpg

8. Now move that file back one directory. 

	cd ..
	mv photographs ..
	

9. Change directories to the like folder under monkeys. Open this folder in sublime. 

	cd Monkeys
	(opened in sublime text)

10. Bonus! Remove the bananas.html file from the like folder. 

cd Monkeys
cd like
rm bananas.html
